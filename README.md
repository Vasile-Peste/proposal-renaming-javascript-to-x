**Stage: 0**
**The following is a strawperson proposal, treat it as such**

## Introduction
The purpose of this proposal is to advocate for a name change of the JavaScript programming language to "X".
This change aims to reflect the evolution of JavaScript beyond its traditional web-centric applications
as a powerful language for server-side development, cross-platform applications, robotics, Internet of Things (IoT),
and various other domains, furthermore we want to address its infamous identity as "the language for building web pages"
and the misleading reputation associated with its name, which inaccurately implies a connection to Java<br>
The proposed new name, "X", embodies the dynamic and versatile nature of the language while offering a
fresh identity that better aligns with its current and future applications.

## JavaScript needs a new identity

### 1. Evolution of JavaScript Beyond the Web
JavaScript has evolved significantly since its inception and is now extensively utilized beyond the web environment.
It has emerged as a powerful language for server-side development, cross-platform applications, robotics, Internet of Things (IoT),
and various other domains. However, the current name, "JavaScript" inherently associates the language with web development,
potentially overshadowing its broader potential and hindering its acceptance in non-web contexts.
JavaScript has historically been associated primarily with web development due to its early adoption in web browsers.
However, this perception has become outdated and misleading, as JavaScript has now found extensive applications beyond the web domain.
Many people still mistakenly believe that JavaScript is exclusively a web language.<br>
Renaming it to "X" would signify this expansion, offering a more inclusive and versatile representation of the language's capabilities.

### 2. Addressing the Infamous Reputation of the Name
The name "JavaScript" has historically been a source of confusion due to its misleading association with the Java programming language.
While JavaScript and Java share some syntactical similarities, they are fundamentally different languages with distinct purposes and ecosystems.
This confusion has led to negative perceptions of JavaScript, with critics claiming that the name misrepresents the language's nature and undermines its credibility.
By renaming it to "X" we can distance the language from this reputation and establish a distinct identity that accurately portrays its characteristics, strengths, and independent development.

### 3. Benefits of the Proposed Name Change
- Enhanced Clarity and Differentiation: The name "X" offers a clear distinction from Java and eliminates the potential for confusion. Developers, educators, and learners will have a more accurate understanding of the language's core features, facilitating its adoption and education across various platforms and contexts.
- Rebranding Opportunity: Renaming JavaScript to "X" presents an exciting opportunity for rebranding and revitalizing the language. It enables a fresh start, shedding any residual negative perceptions associated with the existing name, and positioning the language as a modern and progressive technology.
- Reflecting Versatility: The new name, "X" embodies the dynamic, fast-paced, and adaptable nature of the language, highlighting its suitability for a wide range of applications and environments. It reflects the language's ability to power X-connected, interactive, and intelligent systems.
- Embracing Industry Trends: Renaming JavaScript to "X" aligns with the industry trend of naming programming languages with modern and futuristic connotations. This will help the language stay relevant and appealing to developers, ensuring its continued growth and evolution.
- International Appeal and Cultural Neutrality: "JavaScript" carries with it a certain cultural and linguistic association with the English language and the Western world. By adopting the name "X" the language can present a more neutral and globally inclusive identity. This can facilitate its acceptance and adoption in diverse linguistic and cultural contexts, promoting a sense of inclusivity and expanding its user base worldwide.

### Implementation Considerations & Transition
- Community Engagement: To ensure a smooth transition, it is crucial to engage the JavaScript community in discussions about the proposed name change. Soliciting feedback, addressing concerns, and involving key stakeholders will foster a sense of ownership and promote consensus.
- Clear Transition Strategy: A well-defined transition plan should be developed, outlining the steps involved in adopting the new name across documentation, libraries, tools, and frameworks. The plan should also include guidelines for supporting legacy code and maintaining backward compatibility.
- Communication and Education: An effective communication strategy should be devised to inform developers, organizations, and the broader tech community about the rationale behind the name change. Educational resources and materials should be provided to facilitate a smooth adaptation to the new name.

#### ".x" File Extension
To ensure a seamless transition and support existing codebases, it is essential to prioritize full retro-compatibility with the current JavaScript language specification. The renaming process should not introduce breaking changes or disrupt existing projects, frameworks, or libraries.
One way to facilitate the coexistence of legacy code and the adoption of the new name is by introducing support for the ".x" file extension. This extension would indicate that the code is written in the renamed language, allowing developers to gradually migrate their codebases while maintaining backward compatibility.
Supporting the ".x" file extension provides a clear distinction between the renamed language and the traditional JavaScript files, easing the identification of code written in the new language. This approach allows for a smooth transition, enabling developers to update and refactor their projects incrementally, while still being able to leverage existing JavaScript libraries and tools.
By ensuring full retro-compatibility and introducing the ".x" file extension support, the proposed renaming to "X" can coexist harmoniously with the existing JavaScript ecosystem. Developers can gradually adopt the new name and language features without causing disruptions, providing a stable and reliable environment for both existing and new projects.

Renaming JavaScript to "X" is a strategic step that recognizes its evolution.
